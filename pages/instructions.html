            <h3>Decks & Folders</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Click the Decks page in the navigation bar above to be able to view, study, create, edit & delete decks.</li>
                <li>You are also able to create folders which allow you to organise your decks more, indicated by a folder icon.</li>
                <li>In the Decks page click the <b>[+]</b> button in the top right corner which will allow you to create a deck or folder.</li>
                <li><b>To add cards to a newly created deck</b> click the pencil icon to go into edit mode. You need at least 1 card in a deck to be able to study it.</li>
                <li>With any deck or folder click the pencil icon to edit it and the bin icon to delete it.</li>
                <li>Click the name of a folder (in blue) to go into it.</li>
                <li>Click the name of a deck (in blue) to access study options <b>(Make sure it has at least 1 card!)</b></li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Study Options</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When clicking on a deck, you access its study options: Normal Mode and Spaced Repetition.</li>
                <li>Normal Mode takes all the cards, shuffles them, and presents them to you one by one.</li>
                <li>Spaced Repetition makes it so the more you continously know a card well, the less of a chance it has to show up in the future.</li>
                <li>This point of this is allowing you to revise the harder cards more, and occasionally get the cards you know really well later on to ensure you still know them.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Studying a Deck</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>With whatever study mode you've selected, you will see a front of a card on your screen.</li>
                <li>Once you've thought of the answer, click it to reveal its back.</li>
                <li>3 rating options will appear to ask you how well you knew the card.</li>
                <li>This response is used for the spaced repetition mode.</li>
            </ul>
